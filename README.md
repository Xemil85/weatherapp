Weatherapp made with vue.js and backend for node.js. <br>
It use openweathermap API that we can search weather for city.

## Setting up for application
First clone my repository that you can get files. <br>
Then when you have files then we can install needed depencies for weatherapp and weatherbackend folder <br>
`yarn install`

before we start backend we have to make .env file and needed variables are .env.example file. <br>
Most important variable is `WEATHERKEY` that you can get openweathermap website but you need to sign up to get API key.
